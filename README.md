#### A couple of quick scripts to automagically install a list of homebrew formulae

-- Requirements:

	Homebrew (http://brew.sh)

	BASH

	Python

	File with list of formulae from previous machine -- "$ brew list > file.txt"
	
-- Process:

	0) locate your newline separated file of formulae to install; e.g., ./file.txt
	
	1) from git repo, run "$ bash homebrew.sh file.txt"
	
	2) pour a glass of your favorite beverage (I'll have a Racer 5 IPA, thanks.)
	
	3) wait nearly an eternity (depending on which formulae you're installing)
	
	4) rejoice in having saved yourself some time!
